## Computational software and research for spatial-omics

*__Cardinal MSI__* is a Github organization for software and research in spatial-omics lead by Prof. Kylie Ariel Bemis in collaboration with Olga Vitek Lab at Northeastern University.

We develop and maintain software and computational research tools for:

- __Multidimensional spectral imaging data__, with a particular focus on
- __Mass spectrometry-based imaging experiments__ and
- __Multimodal spatial-omics integration__ for statistics and machine learning

Eventually, the packages *Cardinal* and *matter* will be migrated to this organization.
